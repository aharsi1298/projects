                <h1>The Greatest DeltaRune and UnderTale Player Who Has Ever Existed!</h1>
                <p>I am Aharsi Majumdar, the Greatest DeltaRune and UnderTale Player Ever! I have also created a program which simulates the entire universe and can predict your entire life, which will of course put many fortune tellers out of business,
                    and will also probably hire many assasins to assasinate me. I am working on an OS so large that it bends space-time to follow your very commands. My projects currently outnumber the number of humans who exist.</p>
